### Red, Green, Refactor

These are steps that we repeat for each unit test case

**Red =>** Add a failing test first. This makes us confident that our test is going to fail when we expect it to. There is no point in having a test that cannot catch bugs and always passes.

**Green =>** Update the failing code in our application so that the test passes. 

**Refactor =>** Beutify our code. Remove duplicates, improve the design, make the code easier to read, adhere to coding standards, and the re-run the unit test to make sure it still passes after all of our changes.
